Currently, the user is able post and read messages that will display the correct zone according to the user's location. As you can see in the video, there are three zones in the system. However, since we are currently in Tempe and we simulated that we had been to New York, you can only see zone0 (New York) an zone1 (Tempe). Also, messages within each zone are not visible in other zones. Messages are uploaded instantly then pulled down to and from our Firebase server. If other users are currently viewing the zone, he/she will see the update instantly. As for our server, we have successfully communicated between a cloud computing server, Cloud Code, and cloud storage, Firebase. We were also able to implement the Expectation Maximization algorithm in JavaScript on Cloud Code and are able to correctly cluster and name zones dynamically as the users move or get online. Even though they are two different systems, the lag time is barely noticeable.
