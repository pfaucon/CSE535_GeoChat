Currently, the user is able post and read messages and will display the correct zone according to the user's location. As you can see in the video, currently, in the system there are actually three zones, however, since we are currently in Tempe and we pretended that we had been to New York, therefore, you can only see zone0 (New York) an zone1 (Tempe). Also, messages within each zones are not visible in other zones and messages are uploaded instantly then pull down to and from our Firebase server, if other user are currently viewing the zone, he/she will see the update instantly. As for our server, we have successfully communicated between a cloud computing server, Cloud Code, and a cloud storage, Firebase. We were also able to implement the Expectation Maximization algorithm in JavaScript on Cloud Code and able to correctly cluster and name zones dynamically as the users move or get online. Even though they are two different systems, the lag time is barely noticeable.
