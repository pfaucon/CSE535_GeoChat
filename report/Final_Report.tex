\section{Introduction}
	\IEEEPARstart{I}{n} today's day and age where technology keeps changing and new ideas are born on a daily basis, there are still a lot of holes left to plug in various areas of computing. There has been a tremendous success of mobile apps in the areas of social networking and location based services, and there have been quite a few that combine these 2 disciplines. Our project provides a little a twist to these 2 disciplines to make it different from other apps, and make it better for people on the go.

	\subsection{Project Description}
	
	\subsection{The Need}

		The main use of the app would be for the social networking and getting to know what is going on around you at a given time. There have been a number of other mobile apps that have gained traction lately that relate to anonymous social networking and location based services, but none quite have a good blend of the 2 that can be used on the go.

		The use of a location service where a user is automatically allocated to a zone they are in based on ``hotspots''. This way a user who is new to the area can instantly tell what is going on at the moment based on where other app users are and see if there is anything special going on.

		Another noteworthy use of the app is for getting a live feed of the current event in a ``hotspot''. For example, for a college football game, there could be a large number of users in around the stadium that form a zone and everyone within that zone can talk and discuss about the game on that thread. Users are stored within a zone 24 hours after they have left it if they wanted to discuss the thread for a little while after the event too.
